#Summary
This project aims to eventually create a .jar file that is usable for the base of any application that could utilize polygons to run.
The goal of this project is to learn how to create some sort of physics engine and base for 2D animation/simulation applications.
It will utilize javafx and collision detection code from Jeffrey Thompson in his processing tutorial (which was given a collective commons license).

######Note
If you are curious about this project or would like to suggest/comment anything, feel free! I've created this for the purpose of learning how programs similar to this work, so I would appreciate any and all feedback. (I apologize in advance for the comprehensiveness of this repository, I started this project without planning ahead for that)
