This project aims to eventually create a .jar file that is usable for the base of any application that could utilize polygons to run.
The goal of this project is to learn how to create some sort of physics engine and base for 2D animation/simulation applications.
It will utilize javafx and collision detection code from Jeffrey Thompson in his processing tutorial (which was given a collective commons license).
